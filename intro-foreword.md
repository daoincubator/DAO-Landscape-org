> The experiment started in Berlin as an entrepreneur. Not a researcher as well, but done a lot of market analysis, that I did with mapping. Come from sharing economy, platform coops. Through Ela, started to work with rchain/dgov. Besides, that was researching 50-60 providers from the map, the goal was in identifying challenges and how to integrate them in the ecosystem. Would like to continue with that proposal. The only question is to what degree dgov~DAO are related. Dgov are the tools for organizing people, the step before DAO. You need some rules at the start. Maybe that’s one component of the research.

> In thinking about DAOs and a post-competitive environment, one of the first most obvious projects is creating a shared body of knowledge and point of references. Sharing what we know, what we’ve done, what has worked and what has failed is one of the most basic foundations for research. In overly competitive environments \(traditional industries\), best practices are secret, leveraged to get an advantage over one another. DAO thinking is different. We are interested in using our collective intelligence to progress further, faster, and for the benefit of all of us. My background is in communications, team collaboration, writing, and systems thinking. The first step I took in this body of knowledge was to research if such a thing had been done before, and to speculate on how we might design a search engine for DAO proposals, so that we can have a collective history of what has been done across the industry.

> Collecting and systematizing the info helps seeing patterns, building solid knowledge foundation for any work in the space. Lacking this essential infrastructure can drive us into endless argument about the facts.

> Working with blockchain ecology R&D on multiple projects and part of Genesis DAO since inception. Spent my entire life dedicated to scaffolding commons IRL, happy to help develop digital commons as well. Decentralized knowledge production and reducing information asymmetry in the cryptosphere is what brought me here in particular.
