### eDemocracy

{% hint style="info" %}
Luke Riley can write and academic intro to liquid democracy and how it fits into blockchain
{% endhint %}

[Liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy) is system where everyone has the ability to vote themselves, to delegate their vote to someone else, and to remove the delegation of their vote at any time.

#### Quadratic Voting

[Quadratic voting](http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/) is a system of buying votes, where each additional vote costs twice as much as the one before it. In other words, money buys votes, but with strong diminishing returns. 

* [https://pdaian.com/blog/vote-buying-on-chain-governance-and-quadratic-plutocracy/](https://pdaian.com/blog/vote-buying-on-chain-governance-and-quadratic-plutocracy/)

#### Condorcet method

A **Condorcet method** \(English: [/kɒndɔːrˈseɪ/](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)\) is an [election method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_method) that elects the candidate that would win a majority of the vote in all of the head-to-head elections against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property is called the Condorcet winner. Voting methods that always elect the Condorcet winner, when one exists, satisfy the [Condorcet criterion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_criterion).

### Futarchy / Prediction markets

In [futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy), society defines its values and then prediction markets are used to decide what actions will maximize those values. Said another [way](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/): [“vote on values, bet on beliefs”](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html). It was [originally proposed](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy2000.pdf) in 2000 by [Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/bio), an economics professor at George Mason University.
